- OOP (allows functional but OOP mainly)
- Encapsulation
- Platform Independent (compiled to byte code and once)
- Robust (major advantage over C++, prevents memory leaks and manages memory on its own)
- Simple (than C++, eliminates pointers, no operating overloading)
- Secure (runs inside JDM, creating sandbox, no damage to computer its running on)
